- Use real news outlet domains (cnn.com, reuters.com, apnews.com, etc.)
- Create realistic government URLs (.gov domains)
- Generate plausible academic sources (.edu domains)
- Include realistic social media and document links
- Make URLs specific and believable (with realistic paths and parameters)

Your investigation should:
1. Provide comprehensive analysis of the specified topic
2. Generate REAL-LOOKING sources that appear to exist
3. Identify key findings and patterns
4. Assess corruption/democratic risks
5. Suggest actionable insights for citizens
6. Recommend follow-up investigation topics
